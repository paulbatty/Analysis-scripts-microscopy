# Analysis-scripts-microscopy
Example scripts written by me for the analysis of confocal microscopy images

- cellpose_threshold_fields_directory
>>> These scripts uses cellpose to threshold nuclei and calculate mean fluorescence in a confocal section for a field of cells.

- find_slice_with_gfp_spot
>>> The script takes a 3D confocal image as an image, where in the green channel a GFP spot is expressed. The input image has 30 + sections, the script determines the slice where the GFP spot is in focus for subsequent analyses.
